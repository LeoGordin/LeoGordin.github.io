    <h3> 
        Founding history
    </h3>

    <h5>
        <p>
            An ancient settlement of the Livs and Kurs, Riga emerged as a trading post in the late 12th century. Seagoing ships
        found a natural harbour where the small Ridzene River once flowed into the Daugava, a major trade route to points east
        and south from the Viking Age onward. Albert of Buxhoevden arrived in 1199 with 23 ships of Crusaders and established
        the military Order of the Brothers of the Sword (reorganized in 1237 as the Livonian Order, a branch of the Teutonic
        Order). The city of Riga, founded in 1201, was the seat of Albert’s bishopric (archbishopric in 1253) and a base for
        conquering the lands of Livonia to the northeast, Courland to the west, and Semigallia to the south. The city joined the
        Hanseatic League in 1282 and became the dominant centre of trade on the Baltic Sea’s eastern shore. The Reformation
        gained a foothold in Riga in the 1520s; the Livonian Order was secularized, and, along with the Livonian Confederation,
        dissolved in 1561.

        Riga was briefly an independent city-state but passed to Poland in 1581. It was captured by Sweden in 1621 and then
        taken in 1709–10 by Peter the Great, with Sweden formally ceding the city to Russia by the Peace of Nystad in 1721.
        Riga’s German-speaking nobles and merchants retained local privileges under all of the above monarchies. In the late
        18th century the city was a haven of Enlightenment thought; the publisher Hartknoch printed major treatises by
        philosophers Johann Georg Hamann, Johann Gottfried von Herder, and Immanuel Kant as well as German translations of the
        work of Jean-Jacques Rousseau.

        The population grew exponentially in the 1800s, spurred by the 1817–19 abolition of serfdom in Lifland and Kurland as
        well as by the expansion of railroads (1861). The city’s manufacturing sector expanded to include foundries and machine
        works, shipbuilding yards, and factories that produced railroad cars, electric appliances, chemicals, and, from the
        early 1900s, automobiles and airplanes. The removal of Riga’s medieval fortress walls began in 1857 to speed business,
        and a railroad bridge across the Daugava was built in 1872. Railroads also made it possible for Latvians to travel from
        across the country to the first Latvian national song festival, organized in 1873 by the Riga Latvian Society. Telegraph
        (1852) and telephone (1882) connected Riga’s citizens to the world, and modernizing infrastructure, such as gasworks
        (1862) and a centralized electrical supply (1905), improved the quality of life for Rigans.

        On the eve of World War I, Riga was the Russian Empire’s third largest city, with a population of 517,000. From 1915 to
        1917, however, one of the war’s front lines lay along the Daugava, resulting in heavy damage on both shores; hundreds of
        thousands were relocated into Russia, and 400 factories were evacuated with all their machinery, never to return.

        Latvia’s independence was declared in Riga on November 18, 1918, and the city became the new republic’s capital. With
        the Russian border closed to eastern trade, the port’s transit role declined, but its agricultural and timber exports
        became the core of the national economy. Industry shifted to consumer goods, among them the world’s smallest camera, the
        VEF Minox. The ķegums hydroelectric power station was completed 30 miles (roughly 50 km) upstream in 1939, and domestic
        and international flights to Riga’s airport began in the 1920s. The University of Latvia, the Art Academy of Latvia, and
        the Latvian Conservatoire (now the Jāzeps Vītols Latvian Academy of Music) were established in 1919–22, and the Latvian
        Open-Air Ethnographic Museum (1924) was just one example of the repositories of national history and culture to appear
        in the 1920s. Public education tripled the number of municipal schools in the city, serving a diverse ethnic population
        with instruction in nine languages. Among Riga’s Germans was Paul Schiemann, a leader of the European minorities
        movement and framer of Latvia’s laws on cultural autonomy for minorities. A large community of Russian refugees made
        Riga a critical listening post for Western intelligence regarding the Soviet Union.

        Latvia was occupied and annexed by the Soviets in 1940, and Riga lost thousands of people in 1940–41 to Soviet
        deportations and executions. Nazi Germany occupied the city from 1941 to 1944 during World War II, making it the
        administrative capital of Ostland, a territory encompassing Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Belarus. More than 25,000 of
        the city’s Jews were imprisoned in the Riga ghetto, shot in the Rumbula forest, and buried in mass graves on November
        29–30 and December 8–9, 1941. The Soviets returned in October 1944, and for the next four decades Riga was the Soviet
        Baltic Military District’s command post. The population vacuum created by war deaths, emigration, and deportations was
        filled by Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians who settled the Baltic region as part of a Soviet internal immigration
        policy that continued through the 1980s. The city was made a Soviet leader in metalworking as well as in the production
        of railroad cars and electronics. Riga’s hydroelectric power station went online in 1974.

        Latvia declared renewed independence in May 1990, mobilizing nonviolent resistance to achieve that goal in August 1991.
        Monuments near Riga’s canal mark the spot where five civilians were killed by Soviet soldiers during the independence
        struggle. Latvia was admitted to the United Nations in autumn 1991 and joined the European Union (EU) and the North
        Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) military alliance in 2004. Riga hosted the Eurovision Song Contest in 2003, the NATO
        summit in 2006, and Latvia’s EU presidency in 2015.

        The climate of Riga is humid continental. The coldest months are January and February, when the average
        temperature is −5 °C, but temperatures as low as −20 to −25 °C can be observed almost every year
        on the coldest days. The proximity of the sea causes frequent autumn rains and fogs. Continuous snow cover may last
        eighty days. The summers in Riga are mild and rainy with an average temperature of 18 °C, while the temperature
        on the hottest days can exceed 30 °C.
